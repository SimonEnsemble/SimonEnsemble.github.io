🍷 suppose we own a winery and have produced two large vats of wine---one, pure Syrah; the other, pure Grenache. the following table presents data regarding our cost to produce each variety of wine, the alcohol and acid content of each variety, and our inventory of each variety.

| wine variety | cost   | alcohol content   | acid content | inventory |
|--------------|--------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Syrah        | \$4.5/L | 11% by volume     | 0.38 g/L     | 3000 L |
| Grenache     | \$6.5/L | 13% by volume     | 0.31 g/L     | 4500 L |

a customer will pay us \$8/L for up to 5,000 L of a Syrah/Grenache blend meeting two specifications relating to perceived quality. first, the blend should contain at least 11.5% alcohol by volume. second, the blend should contain less than 0.36 g/L acid.

to maximize our profit, what volume of Grenache and what volume of Syrah should we blend together for the customer?

💻 let's formulate and solve this optimization problem---a linear program---for our optimal wine blend using [`JuMP.jl`](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/) in Julia. 

💡 in this optimization problem, the:
* _decision variables_ are the volume of Syrah and volume of Grenache to blend together.
* _objective function_ [of the decision variables] we wish to maximize is profit.
* [inequality] _constraints_ specify a minimal alcohol and maximal acid content of the wine blend, a maximal total volume of wine blend the customer will purchase from us, and a maximal volume of each variety the blend can contain based on our inventory. (not to mention, the non-negative constraints that are obvious to us, but not to a computer.)

md"🍷 which constraints were active? which were inactive?

the _active_ constraints are the maximal amount of blend the customer will accept and our inventory of Syrah, the cheaper wine variety.

the acid and alcohol specifications constituted _inactive_ constraints.
the Grenache inventory is also an inactive constraint.

# ╔═╡ e12baa22-e32b-4fda-bd9a-3df2afb402ef
md"🍷 since our design space is two dimensional, we can visualize this linear program. we draw the 2D design space, the constraint lines, the feasible region, some profit contours, and the optimal solution.

the _feasible region_ of wine blend designs constitutes the shaded gray region, where
* the blend has sufficient alcohol content
* the blend exhibits sufficiently low acid content
* the customer's capacity to buy the wine blend is not exceeded
* our inventory of each wine is respected
the feasible region is a polygon.

some _profit_ contours are shown as the dashed lines. blends belonging to a profit contour all give us the same profit.

the _optimal solution_ lies at a vertex of the feasible region. at this point, we cannot slide the profit contour to the upper right any further because all of the blends would be infeasible.
here, we clearly see that the only two active constraints are the customer demand and Syrah inventory. 

thinking about changing a constraint, we could make more profit if we had more Syrah in our inventory! with more Syrah, eventually, the acid constraint would come into play and be active.

md"🍷 we gain a lot of insight by visualizing a linear program in 2D, as we did above. we can make sense of the solution and what constraints are active vs. inactive. 

for blends of more than three varieties, we lose this interpretability since we cannot visualize a design space that is greater than 4D.

interestingly, last month, I was drinking [this Oregon wine](https://evolutionwine.com/product/evolution-lucky-no-9-white-2/) that is composed of a blend of _nine_ different varities of white wine❗ hard to imagine a nine-dimensional polytope comprising the feasible region.

❓ I wonder if any wineries actually take such a sophisticated approach to wine blending.

!!! note \"post-fermentation wine blends vs. co-fermentation\"
	we considered a _post_-fermentation wine blend. by contrast, some wine is made by blending the distinct varieties of grapes or grape juices together in the fermenter, then fermenting them together. in that case, I imagine it is much more difficult to predict what the specifications of the wine will be at the end of the fermentation.
