metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are (often) crystalline materials that possess nanometer-sized cavities and exhibit large internal surface areas ($&amp;gt;$7000 m$^2$/g) decorable with functional groups. this endows MOFs with the ability to [selectively] adsorb molecules into their pores/ on their internal surfaces. MOFs have many applications; prominent ones are storing, separating, and sensing gases.
MOFs are synthesized modularly from molecular building blocks: organic linker molecules and inorganic nodes. owing to the (i) abundance of compatible molecular building blocks, (ii) many topologies in which the building blocks assemble, and (iii) post-synthetic modifiability, the number of possible MOF structures is practically limitless.</description></item></channel></rss>
