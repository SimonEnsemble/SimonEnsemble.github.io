A dog 🐶, bear 🐻, and monkey 🐒 go out to eat together at a restaurant. For desert, the server generously brings five cookies (🍪&amp;rsquo;s). How many different ways can the five cookies be distributed among the three diners? The cookies are indistinguisable.
For example, one outcome is:
🐶: 🍪 🍪
🐻:
🐒: 🍪 🍪 🍪
The answer to this combinatorics problem is readily apparent once cast into the stars and bars framework.</description></item><item><title>the German tank problem</title><link>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2019-11-15-german-tank-problem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2019-11-15-german-tank-problem/</guid><description>author: Cory Simon
The German tank problem [1] is intellectually stimulating and makes great conversation at wine bars. The problem has a historical context as well [2].
During World War 2, the Germans inscribed their tanks with sequential serial numbers $1,2,&amp;hellip;,n$ when they were manufactured. The total number of tanks $n$ that the Germans had, however, was unknown to the Allied forces&amp;ndash; and of great interest.
The Allies captured a (assumed) random sample of $k$ tanks from the German forces (without replacement, of course) and observed their serial numbers, $x_1,x_2,&amp;hellip;,x_k$.</description></item></channel></rss>
