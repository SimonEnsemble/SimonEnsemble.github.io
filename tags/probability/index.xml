The German tank problem [1] is intellectually stimulating and makes great conversation at wine bars. The problem has a historical context as well [2].
During World War 2, the Germans inscribed their tanks with sequential serial numbers $1,2,&amp;hellip;,n$ when they were manufactured. The total number of tanks $n$ that the Germans had, however, was unknown to the Allied forces&amp;ndash; and of great interest.
The Allies captured a (assumed) random sample of $k$ tanks from the German forces (without replacement, of course) and observed their serial numbers, $x_1,x_2,&amp;hellip;,x_k$.</description></item></channel></rss>
