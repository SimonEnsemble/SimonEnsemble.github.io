The orthogonal Procrustes problem is to find the orthogonal matrix that maps a given set of points closest to another given set of points; the one-to-one correspondence of points between the two sets must be known a priori. The solution has applications in computer vision, molecular modeling, and speech translation.
The nomenclature refers to a character in Greek mythology, Procrustes, a bandit who stretched or cut off the limbs of his victims to fit his iron bed.</description></item></channel></rss>
