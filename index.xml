metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are (often) crystalline materials that possess nanometer-sized cavities and exhibit large internal surface areas ($&amp;gt;$7000 m$^2$/g) decorable with functional groups. this endows MOFs with the ability to [selectively] adsorb molecules into their pores/ on their internal surfaces. MOFs have many applications; prominent ones are storing, separating, and sensing gases.
MOFs are synthesized modularly from molecular building blocks: organic linker molecules and inorganic nodes. owing to the (i) abundance of compatible molecular building blocks, (ii) many topologies in which the building blocks assemble, and (iii) post-synthetic modifiability, the number of possible MOF structures is practically limitless.</description></item><item><title>the pursuit of science for understanding our natural world</title><link>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2020-01-03-crispr-book/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2020-01-03-crispr-book/</guid><description>author: Cory Simon
First, I recommend the book &amp;ldquo;A Crack in Creation: gene editing and the unthinkable power to control evolution&amp;rdquo; by the pioneer of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology, Jennifer Doudna, and her former graduate student, Samuel Sternberg. The book outlines the story of how the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology was developed, discusses its potential to improve human and plant health, and deliberates over ethical questions surrounding its use.</description></item><item><title>cookies and coffees method for counting</title><link>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2019-11-29-stars-and-bars/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2019-11-29-stars-and-bars/</guid><description>author: Cory Simon
A dog üê∂, bear üêª, and monkey üêí go out to eat together at a restaurant. For desert, the server generously brings five cookies (üç™&amp;rsquo;s). How many different ways can the five cookies be distributed among the three diners? The cookies are indistinguisable.
For example, one outcome is:
üê∂: üç™ üç™
üêª:
üêí: üç™ üç™ üç™
The answer to this combinatorics problem is readily apparent once cast into the stars and bars framework.</description></item><item><title>the German tank problem</title><link>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2019-11-15-german-tank-problem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2019-11-15-german-tank-problem/</guid><description>author: Cory Simon
The German tank problem [1] is intellectually stimulating and makes great conversation at wine bars. The problem has a historical context as well [2].
During World War 2, the Germans inscribed their tanks with sequential serial numbers $1,2,&amp;hellip;,n$ when they were manufactured. The total number of tanks $n$ that the Germans had, however, was unknown to the Allied forces&amp;ndash; and of great interest.
The Allies captured a (assumed) random sample of $k$ tanks from the German forces (without replacement, of course) and observed their serial numbers, $x_1,x_2,&amp;hellip;,x_k$.</description></item><item><title>interactive visualization of a metal-organic cuboctahedron</title><link>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2019-07-07-mo-cage-viz/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2019-07-07-mo-cage-viz/</guid><description/></item><item><title>dynamic models for liquid flow into/out of tanks with complicated geometries</title><link>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2019-03-22-tank-problem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2019-03-22-tank-problem/</guid><description>author: Cory Simon
Problem setup Liquid continuously flows into a truncated square pyramidal tank at a rate $q_i=q_i(t)$ [m$^3$/s]. Hydrostatic pressure drives flow out of the tank through a narrow pipe at its base; via Bernoulli&amp;rsquo;s equation, the outlet flow rate $q\propto \sqrt{h}$, where $h$ [m] is the liquid level in the tank.
The goal here is to derive a dynamic model for the liquid level $h=h(t)$ given any input $q_i(t)$.</description></item><item><title>surface tension catapults in mushrooms</title><link>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2018-11-28-surface-tension-catapult/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2018-11-28-surface-tension-catapult/</guid><description>author: Cory Simon
Fungi Basidiomycota have evolved a fascinating mechanism by which they discharge their spores. The mechanism exploits surface tension in water, which can be intuited1 as the tendency to minimize surface area.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works, aided by a visual pulled from Stolze-Rybczynski et al. [2], who took high-speed videos of these spores launching. The authors [2] dub this a &amp;ldquo;surface tension catapult&amp;rdquo;.
The spore starts off attached to a sterigma.</description></item><item><title>the orthogonal Procrustes problem</title><link>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2018-10-27-orthogonal-procrustes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2018-10-27-orthogonal-procrustes/</guid><description>author: Cory Simon
The orthogonal Procrustes problem is to find the orthogonal matrix that maps a given set of points closest to another given set of points; the one-to-one correspondence of points between the two sets must be known a priori. The solution has applications in computer vision, molecular modeling, and speech translation.
The nomenclature refers to a character in Greek mythology, Procrustes, a bandit who stretched or cut off the limbs of his victims to fit his iron bed.</description></item><item><title>Monte Carlo simulation of airline overbooking</title><link>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2018-07-24-airline-overbooking/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2018-07-24-airline-overbooking/</guid><description>authors: Mira Khare, Melanie Huynh, Arni Sturluson, Cory Simon
Airlines overbook flights to maximize profits.
Consider a flight with seats for 100 passengers.
If the airline allows only up to 100 reservations for the flight, each customer will be guarenteed a seat on the plane. However, several seats will likely be empty because a fraction of the customers that reserve a seat will likely miss the flight. For each empty seat, the airline looses revenue.</description></item><item><title>Monte Carlo simulation of Buffon's Needle</title><link>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2018-04-11-buffon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2018-04-11-buffon/</guid><description>authors: Arthur York, Cory Simon
Buffon&amp;rsquo;s Needle is a famous probability problem emanating from the 18th century.
setup Imagine a floor marked with an infinite number of parallel, equidistant lines, a width $\ell$ apart.
We now toss a needle of length $L&amp;lt;\ell$ onto the floor, where it lands at a uniform random position and with a uniform random orientation. Buffon&amp;rsquo;s needle problem is to determine the probability that the needle intersects one of the lines on the floor.</description></item><item><title>the freely jointed chain model</title><link>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2017-10-6-freelyjointedchain/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonensemble.github.io/posts/2017-10-6-freelyjointedchain/</guid><description>author: Cory Simon
Single-molecule force spectroscopy is a technique to gauge the binding forces within and mechanical properties of biopolymers. For example, consider a DNA unzipping experiment. At the end of a double-stranded DNA molecule, one strand is tethered to a fixed position, and the other, complementary strand is attached to a microsphere under an optical trap. Then, the two strands are pulled apart, and the force is measured as the hydrogen bonds between base pairs break and the DNA molecule unzips.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://simonensemble.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonensemble.github.io/about/</guid><description>hi sup, dude</description></item><item><title/><link>https://simonensemble.github.io/news/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonensemble.github.io/news/</guid><description>Faaiq will enroll in PhD program in Electrical Engineering at Georgia Tech Faaiq Waqar is officially headed to Georgia Tech in the fall to pursue his PhD in Electrical Engineering!
